# TO-DO-list
This is my first major project using the flask framework.
This is a simple to-do list that can be used as a notepad to write down your tasks and be systematic.

# The project is built using:
- HTML5/CSS for frontend
- Python and Flask microframework for the backend


# Installation
To use this template, your computer needs:
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [python2 or python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
